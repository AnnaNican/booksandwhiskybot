# Books & Whisky Bot

Just a simple twitter bot that weekly cretes a new combo of Books & Whisky. The bot sits [here](https://twitter.com/bookswhiskybot) 

The bot was created because of the need of [Books & Whisky Meet-up](http://www.meetup.com/Whisky-Books/) to find the right combination of Books and (yes, correct) Whisky. The input for the bot comes from:
- Books are Sourced from weekly [New York Times Best Seller List](http://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/?_r=0)
- Whisky choices are sourced from [Whisky Monitor](http://www.whisky-monitor.com/newNotes.jsp)

The project is using the followng libraries:
- [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)
- [NYT API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
- [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html)
- pandas (for parsing)
